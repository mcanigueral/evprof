</h2>
<p>This article shows the methodology used to classify EV charging
sessions among generic user profiles, using the R package
<a href="https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/evprof/" class="external-link">evprof</a>. The goal of this analysis is to define generic
<strong>user profiles</strong> or, in other words, <strong>EV connection
patterns</strong> that could relate a charging sessions to a specific
user behaviour. The most relevant variables of the data set are the
<em>Connection Start Time</em> and the <em>Connection Hours
(duration)</em>. Based on these two variables <a href="https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/evprof/" class="external-link">evprof</a>
package aims to provide tools to analyze, cluster and model different
user profiles with similar flexibility potential to, in a farther stage,
exploit their flexibility in specific demand response programs.</p>
<p>The workflow followed to perform in this tutorial is the one
below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data exploratory analysis
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Data set visualization</li>

<p>This article applies the methodology proposed to a real EV data set
from a mid-sized Dutch city. However, the aim of package
<a href="https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/evprof/" class="external-link">evprof</a> is to replicate the same methodology to other real
data sets for any other country in the world, like the example data set
of EV charging sessions provided by <code>evprof</code> (see the <a href="https://mcanigueral.github.io/evprof/articles/california.html" class="external-link">California
article</a>). If you use this package don’t hesitate to comment your
results with the authors of <a href="https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/evprof/" class="external-link">evprof</a>.</p>

<p>The following plot represents with a point every charging session in
hour data set, based on the two most relevant features to define a user
profile: Connection Start Time and Connection Hours (duration).</p>

<p><img src="evprof_files/figure-html/exploration-points-1.png" width="960"></p>
<p>As you can see, the visible “clouds” of points are not plotted in
their natural shape. They are cut because the x axis of the plot goes
from 00:00 to 23:59 of a single day, while the connection patterns start
from 6 AM of one day until the morning of the next day. To solve this
issue, a lot of <code>evprof</code> functions have a <code>start</code>
parameter to set up the hour from which the EV users start their
connections.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/plot_points.html">plot_points</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">sessions</span>, start <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">6</span>, size <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">0.25</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="evprof_files/figure-html/exploration-points-start-1.png" width="960"></p>
<p>This <code>start</code> parameter can be defined with a global option
since most function have the default value as
<code>start = getOption("evprof.start.hour")</code>. Since this
parameter depends on the use case, we recommend to define it at the
beginning of the analysis:</p>

<p>Even though average values don’t give a clear view of the sessions,
in general our data set has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low charging power (new EV models can charge up to 22 kW AC),
probably most of sessions charge with 3.7 or 7.3 kW rates.</li>
<li>Low energy demand (most of models have at least 40 kWh of battery),
probably due to the energy spent in the travel home-city.</li>
<li>Long connections, probably during the night.</li>
<li>Low charging hours due to low energy demand.</li>
<li>High flexibility due to long connections and low energy demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the goal of analyzing different user profiles is to find
groups of sessions with different features averages. A more depth
overview of the data set in this sense can be done with a distribution
plot (histogram) of each one of these features:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/plot_histogram_grid.html">plot_histogram_grid</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">sessions</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="evprof_files/figure-html/histograms-1.png" width="960"></p>
<p>There is no feature that fits a Gaussian distribution, and some
features like <code>ConnectionHours</code> have more than one peak in
the distribution curve. This shows the existence and combination of
different EV user profiles with independent distributions.</p>

<p>The clustering method used in package <a href="https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/evprof/" class="external-link">evprof</a> is
Gaussian Mixture Models with Expectation-Maximization algorithm,
wrapping functions from <a href="https://mclust-org.github.io/mclust/" class="external-link">mclust</a> package. To obtain a
better performance in GMM clustering it is important to divide the data
in smaller groups and clean the outliers, since the different density
distributions will result more accentuated and easy to model.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="divide-the-data">Divide the data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#divide-the-data"></a>

<p>The division is performed in two steps:</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="disconnection-day-division">Disconnection day division<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#disconnection-day-division"></a>
</h4>
<p>The different data points groups that stand out from overview plot
correspond to sessions disconnection day. With function
<code>plot_division_lines</code> we can visualize a division from a
certain hour. We will set the division line from 3:00 AM, which means
that sessions below division line disconnect before 3:00 AM of that day,
each line corresponding to a different day.</p>

<p>After finding the proper hour to make the division, function

extra column to the data set, <code>Disconnection</code>, with the
number of the corresponding disconnection day. The sessions distribution

<p>It is also important to consider the time-cycles or periods when
users change their behaviors. The function <code>plot_density_2D</code>
lets to analyze the different density of sessions (i.e. users behavior)
according to different weekday, month or year.</p>

<p>While depending on the weekday the density of sessions is highly
diverse, between months we can’t see a big difference. Moreover, we
could see different distributions on Monday-Thursday, Friday, Saturday
and Sunday, thus we will consider four different groups: working days
(Monday - Thursday), Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays. The division for
time-cycles sessions is performed by function
<code><a href="../reference/divide_by_timecycle.html">divide_by_timecycle()</a></code>, which adds an extra column
<code>Timecycle</code> to the sessions data set with the number of
time-cycle according to function parameters <code>months_cycles</code>
and <code>wdays_cycles</code>.</p>

<p>Once the two division approaches are applied, our data set counts
with two extra columns (<code>Disconnection</code> and
<code>Timecycle</code>) to classify each data point within each group.
These columns have integer values corresponding to each division. For a
more readable data set we can change these integer values by character
strings with the definition of each group, and convert them to
<code>factors</code> to set a specific order of the levels.</p>
<p>However, in the Disconnection day division we have seen that sessions
disconnecting 2, 3 or 4 days after the connection represent just a 3% of
the total data set. Thus, for obtaining generic user profiles these
sessions will be discarded. The two <em>Disconnection</em> groups that
we will analyze are the sessions that disconnect during the same
connection day, labeled as <strong>City sessions</strong>, and the
sessions that disconnect the day after connection, named <strong>Home
sessions</strong>. At the same time, each <em>Time-cycle</em> group has
the name of the corresponding weekday: <strong>Workday</strong>,
<strong>Friday</strong>, <strong>Saturday</strong> and
<strong>Sunday</strong>.</p>

<p>As explained, the clustering method used in package
<a href="https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/evprof/" class="external-link">evprof</a> is Gaussian Mixture Models clustering. This method
is sensible to outliers since it tries to explain as most as possible
all the variance of the data. This results to wide and low-precision
Gaussian distributions (clusters). Therefore <a href="https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/evprof/" class="external-link">evprof</a>
package provides different functions to detect and filter outliers. At
the same time, it is also recommended to perform the clustering process
in a logarithmic scale, to include negative values to originally
positive variables. The logarithmic transformation can be done in a lot
of functions setting the <code>log</code> parameter to
<code>TRUE</code>. We can visualize the data of each subset:</p>

<p>In these plots we see that every group has several points that stand
out from most of points. These outliers can be detected specifying a
<strong>noise threshold</strong> (in percentage) in function
<code><a href="../reference/detect_outliers.html">detect_outliers()</a></code>. This function adds a logical column
<code>Outlier</code> to the sessions data set showing if a session
whether a session is considered outlier. This classification can be
visualized with function <code><a href="../reference/plot_outliers.html">plot_outliers()</a></code> which shows the
outliers in grey and the noise level (in percentage) in the title of the
graph. This <code>Outlier</code> extra column can be removed together
with outliers with function <code><a href="../reference/drop_outliers.html">drop_outliers()</a></code>. Additionally,
to simply discard sessions from a certain limit in both axis (i.e
connection hours or starting hour), function <code><a href="../reference/cut_sessions.html">cut_sessions()</a></code>
filters the sessions data set according to the specified minimum and
maximum limits of the corresponding axis.</p>
<p>The following plots show the noise-detection process performed for
the charging sessions data set and the corresponding filtering,
resulting in 8 different clean sub sets ready to be clustered.</p>

<p>Function <code>cluster_sessions</code> perform a classification of
sessions adding an extra column <code>Cluster</code> with the
corresponding cluster number. However, Gaussian Mixture Models need a
predefined number of clusters <code>k</code>. Moreover, this function
also requires a <code>seed</code> in order to define a specific random
seed and being able to reproduce specifics clustering results.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="parameters-selection">Parameters selection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameters-selection"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Bayesan Information Criterion (BIC) is a common approach to find
the optimal number of clusters to consider for the GMM clustering. BIC
values are an approximation to intergrated likelihood (explained
variance in data) with a penalty on the number of components, so the
‘best’ model is the one with the highest BIC among the fitted
models.</p>
<p>To evaluate the BIC of your data sets according to the number of
components use function <code><a href="../reference/choose_k_GMM.html">choose_k_GMM()</a></code>, for example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/choose_k_GMM.html">choose_k_GMM</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">sessions_workday_city</span>, k <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">3</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">10</span>, log <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">T</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>After generating a BIC plot for each one of the 8 sub-sets, the
selected number of clusters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sessions workday city: <code>k = 6</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions workday home: <code>k = 6</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Friday city: <code>k = 6</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Friday home: <code>k = 6</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Saturday city: <code>k = 5</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Saturday home: <code>k = 5</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Sunday city: <code>k = 5</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Sunday home: <code>k = 6</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, since Gaussian Mixture Modeling depends on the random seed of
the operation, it is recommended to repeat the clustering process
several times and observe the variability. If different clusters are
obtained in each repetition, it means that there is still too much noise
or variance in the data, or that a different number of clusters should
be selected. Function <code><a href="../reference/save_clustering_iterations.html">save_clustering_iterations()</a></code> repeats
the clustering the number of times specified in the <code>it</code>
parameter and saves the results in a PDF file. From this file, then we
can choose the optimal seed according to the BIC value. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/save_clustering_iterations.html">save_clustering_iterations</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>

<span>  filename <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"figures/clusters/workday_city_k-6.pdf"</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For this study case, each data sub-set has been clustered 6 times and
the optimal seeds for each sub-set have resulted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sessions Workday city: <code>seed = 91</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Workday home: <code>seed = 643</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Friday city: <code>seed = 311</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Friday home: <code>seed = 436</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Saturday city: <code>seed = 668</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Saturday home: <code>seed = 537</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Sunday city: <code>seed = 908</code>
</li>
<li>Sessions Sunday home: <code>seed = 566</code>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Finally, we can cluster each sub-set with function
<code><a href="../reference/cluster_sessions.html">cluster_sessions()</a></code>, specifying the parameters
<code>k</code> and <code>seed</code> with the corresponding values
previously found:</p>

<p>Clusters obtained from GMM don’t give a lot of information themselves
and separately may have an unclear meaning. In this section we will
define each cluster to give them a meaning and relate them to generic
user behaviors, i.e. user profiles. Moreover, not every clusters must
correspond to a single user profile, clusters with the same or a similar
meaning can be grouped to a user profile. Thus, the combination of these
multiple Gaussian Mixture Models into a single user profile is what we
expect to result in a daily generic behavior of EV users.</p>
<p>As a tool to define the different clusters, function
<code><a href="../reference/define_clusters.html">define_clusters()</a></code> prints the average value of the
connection start time and connection duration (i.e. the centroid) of
each cluster. If the cluster process was performed in logarithmic scale,
these values are transformed to natural scale for a better
understanding. Moreover, we can pass to the parameters
<code>interpretations</code> and <code>profile_names</code> a list of
character strings with the corresponding interpretation of the centroids
(e.g. “Connection after work-time, leaving always next morning”) and the
user profile name assigned to each interpretation (e.g. “Commuter”).</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Friday Home cluster that leave next day is not so narrow
(concentrated) than Workday Home cluster since people has no timetable
on weekends morning.</li>
<li>The Commuter profile on Fridays is different than Workdays Commuter
since the after-work sessions are more dispersed in terms of both
starting time and duration. This could be a result of not working on
Friday afternoon (or leave early from work) and not having to leave
early next morning.</li>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Friday Home cluster that leave next day is not so narrow
(concentrated) than Workday Home cluster since people has no timetable
on weekends morning. The weekends user profiles are more variable and
less clear.</li>
<li>On weekends we don’t have commuters since they don’t go from work to
home, thus the afternoon sessions belong now to Home profile.</li>

definitions with function <code><a href="../reference/define_clusters.html">define_clusters()</a></code>, we can use the
data frame that this function outputs as the
<code>clusters_definition</code> parameter of function
<code><a href="../reference/set_profiles.html">set_profiles()</a></code>. This function wraps all sub-sets sessions
and clusters definitions to return a total sessions data set with an
extra <code>Profile</code> column, finishing with this function the user
profile classification of the charging sessions data set. The other
parameter that function <code><a href="../reference/set_profiles.html">set_profiles()</a></code> needs is the

<p>Although the same user profiles names are used in all time-cycles, we
can appreciate some differences that support our approach to make a
model for each time-cycle independently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worktime sessions appear with a clear shape only during working
days, while on weekends the morning sessions are more variable and have
been assigned to the Visit user profile. The Worktime sessions on Friday
are the half of Worktime sessions on any other working day.</li>
<li>Short-stay sessions are in minority during Weekends days since we
have longer sessions instead, or some business places are closed.</li>
<li>The Home profile present narrower cluster shapes when the next day
is a working day (Workday and Sunday time-cycles). When users don’t have
a defined timetable the following day, sessions are more variable in
terms of both duration and start time.</li>
<li>Dinner profile has more importance during Sundays than the other
time-cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude the profiling section, we could summarize the user
profiles with the following classification based on their connections
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Specific profiles</strong>: all sessions have similar start
time <em>and</em> connection duration
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Worktime</strong>: connections start between 8:00 and 9:00,
with a duration of 8-9 hours.</li>
<li>
<strong>Commuters</strong>: connections start between 18:00 and
19:00, with a duration of 13-14 hours (leaving between 7:00-8:00 of next
day)</li>
<li>
<strong>Diner</strong>: connections start between 18:00 and 19:00,
with a duration of 3-4 hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Semi-specific profiles</strong>: sessions have similar start
time <em>or</em> connection duration.
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Shortstay</strong>: connection duration of 1.5 hours in
average.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pillow</strong>: connection start time from 21:00.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Variable profiles</strong>: sessions with a wide range of
start time and connection duration values
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Visit</strong>: city sessions that start during all day with
a variety of short and long connection duration.</li>
<li>
<strong>Home</strong>: home sessions that start during all afternoon
not necessarily leaving next day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>As seen before, we have divided the data in two subsets considering
the time-cycles where EV user profiles change their behaviors. In this
case we have four different time cycles: Workdays, Fridays, Saturdays
and Sundays.</p>
<p>Each time-cycle has its own <strong>connection models</strong>
(connection start time and duration) based on the Gaussian Mixture
Models corresponding to every user profile. However, to estimate new
charging sessions we need to <strong>model the energy required</strong>
as well. The energy consumed is very sensitive to latest models of EV in
the market, since the batteries and charging rates are larger with every
new model. To deal with this variability, it is recommended to build
energy models using the most recent data in the data set. Moreover, the
energy models should be done separately according to the
<code>Power</code> charging rate, since this is a determinant variable
for the value of energy charged.</p>
<p>Each time-cycle model will be stored in <code>tibbles</code> with the
following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>profile</code>: Character vector with profiles names. Each
profile is a row in the tibble.</li>
<li>
<code>profile_ratio</code>: Numeric vector with the ratio or
percentage of sessions corresponding to each profile for this time
cycle, obtained from function <code><a href="../reference/get_connection_models.html">get_connection_models()</a></code>. In
case of modifying these ratios, their values must be always between 0
and 1.</li>
<li>
<code>connection_models</code>: List of tibbles containing the
connection models of each profile, obtained from function
<code><a href="../reference/get_connection_models.html">get_connection_models()</a></code>.</li>
<li>
<code>energy_models</code>: List of tibbles containing the energy
models of each profile, obtained from function
<code><a href="../reference/get_energy_models.html">get_energy_models()</a></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On one hand, after obtaining the connection models (i.e. bi-variate
Gaussian Mixture Models weights, means and co-variance matrices) with
function <code><a href="../reference/get_connection_models.html">get_connection_models()</a></code>, we can visualize them
with function <code><a href="../reference/plot_model_clusters.html">plot_model_clusters()</a></code> which outputs a similar
ellipses plot than function <code><a href="../reference/plot_bivarGMM.html">plot_bivarGMM()</a></code> but using a
different color for each user profile instead of clusters (the clusters
of a same profile have the same color now).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the energy models (i.e. uni-variate Gaussian
Mixture Models weights, means and variance) obtained with function
<code><a href="../reference/get_energy_models.html">get_energy_models()</a></code> can be visualized with function
<code>plot_energy_models_density()</code>. We will create an energy
model for every different charging rate in <code>Power</code> column of
the data set. Therefore, to avoid overfitting, the <code>Power</code>
value of all sessions has to be rounded to the three most common values
in the charging infrastructure: 3.7 kW, 7.4 kW and 11 kW.</p>

<p>The package <a href="https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/evprof/" class="external-link">evprof</a> proposes a standard format for the
EV model with the function <code><a href="../reference/get_ev_model.html">get_ev_model()</a></code>. This function
returns an object of class <code>evmodel</code>, which can be used then
as input of <a href="https://mcanigueral.github.io/evsim/" class="external-link">evsim</a> package to simulate new sessions. The
function requires the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>names</code>: Character vector with the names of the time
cycle</li>
<li>
<code>months_lst</code>: List of numeric vectors, each observation
containing the months of validity of each time cycle</li>
<li>
<code>wdays_lst</code>: List of numeric vectors, each observation
containing the weekdays of validity (week start = 1) of each time
cycle</li>
<li>
<code>connection_GMM</code>: List of the connection models returned
by function <code><a href="../reference/get_connection_models.html">get_connection_models()</a></code>
</li>
<li>
<code>energy_GMM</code>List of the connection models returned by
function <code><a href="../reference/get_energy_models.html">get_energy_models()</a></code>

<p>To simulate new sessions with our models we will make use of package
<a href="https://mcanigueral.github.io/evsim/" class="external-link">{evsim}</a>. We need the
following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of sessions of each model</li>
<li>User profiles proportions for each model</li>
<li>Charging powers proportions</li>
</ul>
<p>We will compare the current demand with the demand obtained from our
models for a certain period, for example the two first weeks of
September 2019. The time series demand from a sessions data set can also
be obtained with <code>evsim</code> package, using function
<code><a href="https://mcanigueral.github.io/evsim/reference/get_demand.html" class="external-link">evsim::get_demand()</a></code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the function <code><a href="https://mcanigueral.github.io/evsim/reference/simulate_sessions.html" class="external-link">simulate_sessions()</a></code> requires the
<code>dates</code> of the simulated sessions and the
<code>interval_mins</code> as the time resolution (in minutes).
Moreover, parameters <code>connection_log</code> and
<code>energy_log</code> must be <code>TRUE</code> if the models have
been built in a logarithmic scale.</p>
<p>With all these parameters in hand we can simulate new sessions:</p>

because we are not doing a forecasting model but a simulation model,
without inputs that predetermine a particular output. What we can
compare is the day times where the demand peaks or valleys occur, and
this is a positive comparison for our models, which coincide almost
perfectly with the real demand. Moreover, the peak values are in general
in concordance with the real peaks.</p>

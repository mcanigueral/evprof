# Profiling EV sessions with {evprof}

This package aims to provide tools for classifying EV charging sessions into smaller groups with similar flexibility potential (i.e. user profiles). The goal of obtaining these user profiles is to, in a later step, define a specific smart charging strategy to each group, considering its flexibility potential and constraints.
Visit the [package site](https://mcanigueral.github.io/evprof/) for more information.

# {evprof}: tools for EV profiling

This package provides the tools for classifying electric vehicles charging sessions into generic groups with similar flexibility potential (i.e. user profiles). The goal of obtaining these user profiles is to, in a later step, define a specific smart charging strategy to each group, considering their flexibility potential and constraints. Visit the [package site](https://mcanigueral.github.io/evprof/) for more information.

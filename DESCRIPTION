Title: Characterizing EV charging sessions into generic user profiles
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Marc",
           family = "CaÃ±igueral",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: This package aims to provide tools for classifying EV charging sessions into smaller groups with
    similar flexibility potential (i.e. user profiles). The goal of obtaining these user profiles is to, in a 
    later step, define a specific smart charging strategy to each group, considering its flexbility potential
    and constraints.

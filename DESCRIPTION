Description: Tools for classifying electric vehicle charging 
    sessions into generic groups with similar connection patterns named 
    "user profiles", using Gaussian Mixture Models clustering.
    Functions to build Gaussian models for every user profile are also 
    provided to simulate new charging sessions.

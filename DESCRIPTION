Description: This package aims to provide tools for classifying EV charging 
    sessions into generic groups with similar connection patterns named 
    "user profiles", using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) clustering method.
    Moreover, functions to build stochastic models (based on GMM) for every
    user profile are also provided in order to simulate new EV sessions.
